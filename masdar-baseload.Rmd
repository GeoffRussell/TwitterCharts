Tweet says 5.2GW solar and 19GWh battery

[Press release](https://masdar.ae/en/news/newsroom/uae-president-witnesses-launch-of-worlds-first-24-7-solar-pv-battery-storage) says 1 GW baseload from
this configuration. 


```{r}
# at 30% CF
cf=0.20
dailyEnergyGWh<-5.2e9*24*cf/1e9

```

The claims imply a 20% capacity factor; which is way too low for Abu Dhabi. It should be 28% of so.

```{r}
# at 30% CF
cfexpected=0.28
dailyEnergyGWh<-5.2e9*24*cfexpected/1e9
```

At 28% CF the average output is 35 GWh per day. The chart in the tweet says 24 GWh per day.

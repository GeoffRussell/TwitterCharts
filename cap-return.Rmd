## Cap Return 

This is a concept used by AEMO to analyse electricity costs. Wholesale costs are set every 5 minutes. 
They obviously have a mean. But prices above $300/MWh have a special significance. So they
chart the average price as two components. 

```{r }
p<-rnorm(288,mean=200,sd=150)
l<-p[p<300]
h<-p[p>300]
mp<-mean(p)
ml<-mean(l)

df<-data.frame(price=p) |> summarise(energy=mean(price[price<300]),cap=mean(price)-mean(price[price<300])) |> pivot_longer(cols=c("energy","cap")) |> mutate(x="x")
df |> ggplot()+geom_col(aes(x=x,fill=name,y=value))+labs(x="",y="$/MWh",title="Average cost with above CAP component")

```

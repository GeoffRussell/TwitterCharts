## Calculate e-vinci shielding info 

Nick Touran on `decouple` raised questions about shieding requirements of the Westinghouse e-vinci 5MWe micro-reactor.

Let's try and work out what is needed from first principles.

This webpage has [some information](https://westinghousenuclear.com/data-sheet-library/evinci-microreactor-the-next-generation-nuclear-research-reactor/) about neutron
flux. And a figure indicating some shielding is packed in the reactor; only at one end.

The webpage says it can provide 5MWe or 6 MWth at 150C.

According to Leah Crider from Westinghouse the steam comes to the generator at over 700 C.

So let's start guessing. The core looks to be about 800 centimeters in diameter and 1.2m long. Leah 
referred to the circumference, and it looks like a cylinder. 

```{r calc}
dia<-0.8
length<-1
circ<-2*pi*dia/2
```

We assume the gammas leave the core in every direction with equal probability so that the flux out of the 
core is just equal to the surface area.

```{r}
area<-circ*length+2*(pi*dia/2)
```

When the reactor is running we assume the power is 15 MWth. 
And that about 6 percent of the energy from every fission is in the form of a gamma emission; based 
on Murray and Holbert "Nuclear Energy" (7th Edition); page 94. When U-233 fissions the gamma has 5.0 MeV of the total
197.9 MeV.

```{r}
power<-15e6
gperc<-5/197.9
```

The fraction of the power that is gamma is in watts ... joules per second.

```{r}
gammapower<-power*gperc
```

We are generating `r gammapower` joules per second of gamma ray energy.

Gray is the measurement of radiation in joules/kilogram.
So if you placed a spherical 1 kg object on the surface of the core with a 10cm diameter. It would be getting a constant
radiation flux equal to the joules per second proportional to the area.

```{r}
targetDia<-10e-2   # m
targetArea<-pi*(targetDia/2)^2
(targetArea/area)
targetGrays<-(targetArea/area)*gammapower
```

So each second, the target is getting a `r targetGrays` Gray dose.

Place a 70kg person 2 meter from the centre of the core. What would the Grays be? 

Assume the core is a sphere, to make it easy to calculate the gamma flux. Assume the person
is a rectangle 180cm tall and 25cm wide. Calculate a 60 second dose. 

Assume air has no impact.

```{r}
pHeight<-1.8
pWidth<-25e-2
pArea<-pHeight*pWidth
pWeight<-70
sphereDia<-2
sphereSArea<-4*pi*(sphereDia/2)^2
pArea/sphereSArea
# grays = joules/kilo
pGrays<-((pArea/sphereSArea)*gammapower)/pWeight
pGrays*60
```
